# About Nick

"And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus."- Col 3:17

For the passed eleven years Nick has served

in various aspects of ministry from media, missions,

youth, teaching, counseling, worship, Christian education

and Home Fellowship oversight.

At his local church, he began to fall in love with

the study of God's Word through exegetical teaching.

Shortly after, while sensing both a personal need and a

call to ministry, he and his wife decided to further their

understanding by attending Calvary Chapel Bible Institute

in Fort Lauderdale.

While attending C.C.B.I., earning a diploma in Biblical

Studies with an emphasis on pastoral ministry, he also

worked in the church's media ministry where he edited

and reproduced resource materials for the church body.

After graduation and the birth of his first child, he

returned to his home church to fill the role of the school's

principal, where he has served for the passed nine years.

As a principal, he has been involved in the lives of many

families and students, encouraging and exhorting them to

Christ-centered, biblical living. The role involves

counseling, teaching, mentoring, oversight of staff,

budgeting and other administrative duties. He has also had

the privilege of leading students and parents on various

mission trips to domestic and international rescue missions

serving the homeless, orphaned and substance abusers,

intending to model the call of Christ to others-centered living.

He has taught the Bible both topically as well as exegetically

through the OT, Romans, Hebrews, Acts, and John. Other

responsibilities include oversight of the home fellowship

ministry.

In 2010 Nick enrolled in Reformed Theological

Seminary to further his biblical understanding in serving the

body of Christ.

Most importantly, Nick is a happily married

husband and father of three. He and wife have

been married for thirteen years this November, and grow more

in love with one another every year.
