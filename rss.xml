            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The outcome of the wicked</h1><p>Why would a loving God who loves by nature send anyone to Hell? If everyone will not be saved, then Christ died in vain and there was no victory at the Cross. Surely it is a failure if an all-powerful God cannot save all. God is a gracious and merciful God, therefore, He will save everybody. It would be unjust if God condemned some to eternal damnation. How could we saints in Heaven celebrate if someone we knew and loved was being tortured forever and ever? I cannot serve a God like that.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/15fc818deebde7bf47cd145d33dd57117e4cfdbb.jpg"></article>]]></description>
